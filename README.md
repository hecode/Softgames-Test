Softgames Test

There should be error handling and loading indicators that I haven't included but should be a part of actual apps.
Similarily for some services, for example for notifications handling, and there should also be a permissions view before asking for the actual native permission.
I would also be using swiftlint in real applications, and for the communication between js and swift would be using json and objectmapper to map to models, etc.
and would be using the mvvm architecture and would be using separate xib files instead of a storyboard and more proper unit testing.
